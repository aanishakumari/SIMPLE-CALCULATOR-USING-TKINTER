# SIMPLE-CALCULATOR-USING-TKINTER
In today's world, calculators have become an essential tool for everyday use, from performing
basic mathematical operations to solving complex scientific problems. With the growing demand
for calculators, there is a need for user-friendly and intuitive calculator applications that can be
easily used by anyone, regardless of their level of mathematical expertise. In this project report,
we present the development of a calculator application using the Python library Tkinter. Tkinter
is a widely used GUI toolkit for Python that allows the creation of interactive and attractive user
interfaces. Our project aims to develop a simple yet efficient calculator that can perform basic
arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This report will
discuss the different aspects of the project, including the design and implementation of the
calculator application using Tkinter. We will describe the different features and functionalities of
the calculator and explain how it handles user input and performs mathematical operations.
Additionally, we will discuss the testing and debugging process of the calculator, ensuring its
accuracy and reliability. Overall, this project report highlights the importance of user-centered
design and testing in software development. It also showcases the versatility of Tkinter as a tool
for developing user-friendly and interactive GUI applications.
